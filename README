Welcome to Gnip's Perl convenience library!

=Overview=

This library consists of a Perl module called Gnip that can be used
to conveniently access Gnip services.  This module can be instantiated
with:

  my $gnip = new Gnip($username, $password); 

assuming you have declared the $username and $password variables
with valid credentials for accessing a Gnip account.

Once a Gnip instance is created, it can be used to publish activities
to a Gnip Publisher that you own using:

  $gnip->publish($publisher_name, $activities_xml);

Activities can be retrieved using:

  $activities_xml = $gnip->get_notifications($publisher_name);

and activity buckets can be accessed using a date/time string
or just by getting the (default) current bucket.

Additional API methods allow you to create, modify, and delete
Filters on a Publisher as well as access notifications and
activities for one of your Filters.

Note, the data that goes into / comes out of a Gnip instance
are XML documents that you must parse.  To help with detecting
error conditions, all of the functions that connect to a Gnip 
server over the network return the HTTP response status code. 

If an HTTP request is successful, the return $content could 
contain a <filters>, <activities>, or other XML document
described in Gnip.xsd.  Otherwise, $content will contain
the error XML document.

=Notes=
* Minimal tests are provided in GnipTester.pl and in addition to 
testing show basics of using the Gnip API.  To execute the tests,
run:
  perl GnipTester.pl
to see usage for passing username, password, and the name of a 
publisher that you own.

* Docstrings are also included for each method.

* The Gnip module requires several 3rd party libraries including:
  - DateTime
  - DateTime::Format::Strptime
Additionally, communication to a Gnip server is done over SSL which
requires that Perl be configured with SSL support.  Please use Google
to find README.SSL for more information.

* Gnip welcomes contributions to this library, so if you encounter 
bugs, want to provide a patch, or just have general feedback, please
send mail into the Gnip community which is here:
